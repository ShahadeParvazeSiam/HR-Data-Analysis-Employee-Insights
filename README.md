# 👩‍💼 HR Data Analysis — Employee Insights

## 📊 Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing **Human Resources (HR) employee data** to uncover valuable insights about workforce trends, retention, performance, and organizational health.  
The goal is to visualize HR data effectively and support **data-driven decisions** in employee management and business strategy.

By leveraging **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**, I performed data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, trends, and insights about employee behavior and company performance.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Understand employee demographics and workforce distribution  
- Identify key factors influencing **attrition and job satisfaction**  
- Explore relationships between **salary, experience, and department**  
- Visualize HR metrics to guide better decision-making in talent management

## 🗂️ Dataset Overview  
The dataset contains detailed information about employees including their demographics, job-related details, and attrition status.

| Feature | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| `EmployeeID` | Unique identifier for each employee |
| `Age`, `Gender`, `Department` | Demographic details |
| `Education`, `JobRole` | Qualification and job position |
| `MonthlyIncome` | Employee salary |
| `YearsAtCompany` | Experience within the organization |
| `Attrition` | Whether the employee left the company (Yes/No) |
| `JobSatisfaction`, `WorkLifeBalance` | Rating metrics |
| `PerformanceRating` | Annual performance evaluation |

## 🧹 Data Cleaning  
- Removed duplicate and null values  
- Standardized column names for consistency  
- Verified and corrected inconsistent categorical data  
- Checked for outliers and unrealistic numerical values (e.g., negative income)

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 💡 Key Insights  
- **Attrition Trends:** Younger employees (<30) had higher attrition rates.  
- **Salary Gaps:** Employees in **Sales** and **HR** had lower median incomes than **R&D**.  
- **Gender Distribution:** Slightly higher male participation in technical roles.  
- **Job Satisfaction:** Mid-level employees reported lower satisfaction scores.  
- **Experience Impact:** Longer tenure correlated with higher performance ratings.

## 📈 Visualizations  
- Attrition by age group and department  
- Salary distribution across job roles  
- Gender ratio per department  
- Correlation between satisfaction and performance  
- Heatmaps for attrition and workload relationships  

> All visualizations were created using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** with professional, minimal styling for clarity.
